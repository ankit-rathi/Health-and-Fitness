Subject: Requirement Modeling Update and Approach Discussion

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share some updates and insights regarding our requirement modeling discussions:

Initially, I began modeling the requirements based on fixed schema principles, following the ER model.

However, a discussion with Sud shed light on the need for a flexible schema approach, prompting a reassessment of our modeling strategy.

After careful consideration of the pros and cons of both approaches, it became evident that our solution requires a dynamic modeling approach.

While the fixed schema approach may not fully align with our requirements, it became apparent that the flexible schema approach has its limitations, particularly regarding schema validation and performance.

To optimize our solution, we concluded that we need to handle fixed and flexible schemas separately to leverage the benefits of both approaches effectively.

As a result, we propose maintaining a fixed schema for certain attributes, modeled according to the ERD principles.

Conversely, for uncertain or unknown attributes, we will adopt a flexible schema approach, either through EAV or JSON modeling techniques.

While both EAV and JSON modeling approaches have their respective advantages and disadvantages, we believe that JSON modeling is better suited for the flexible part of our requirements.

Additionally, I learned from Anu about the requirements for consolidation and metadata for unstructured documents, and I am seeking further clarity on this aspect.

Thank you for your attention to these points. Your input and feedback are invaluable as we refine our approach to meet our project objectives effectively.
